Workflow**:
- Detect behaviors using heuristic and RL modules.
- Map detected behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for context and enrichment.
- Use mapped techniques for reporting and further investigation.

### 5. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting

**Purpose**: To provide real-time detection and alerting of potential threats.

**Components**:
- **Dashboard**: A user interface built with tools like Grafana or Kibana to visualize real-time data.
- **Alerting System**: Integrated with systems like Slack, email, or SIEM for instant notifications.

**Workflow**:
- Monitor network traffic in real-time using trained models.
- Trigger alerts based on detection thresholds.
- Display alerts and traffic analysis on the dashboard.
