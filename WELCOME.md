# WELCOME 

Hi there,

At the moment it's just been me dabbling around with this stuff and I could really use some expert Engineering to go with some ideas that may or may not be feasible.

Take this as my formal apology for code cleanliness and readability. If you did decide to contribute your expertise I would make it my primary focus to clean out the experimental and properly commment what exists.

All criticisms welcome!
