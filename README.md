#Encrypted Data, Adversarial Networks, and Defence Project

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring the intersection of privacy-preserving technologies and adversarial machine learning within the PyTorch ecosystem. On 10 May 2024, we embarked on an innovative project that leverages Crypten for encrypted computations and advertorch for managing adversarial data, creating a robust training environment aimed at developing new heuristics for machine learning models.

### Project Goals
Experiment with Adversarial Attacks: Utilize advertorch to generate and defend against adversarial attacks, enhancing our models' robustness.
Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: Employ Crypten to perform computations on encrypted data, ensuring privacy and security.
Robust Logging: Implement detailed logging mechanisms to analyze behavior and traffic patterns post-experiments.
Rust Integration: Develop a Rust wrapper to facilitate fast and efficient experimentation, providing a high-performance interface to the underlying Python libraries.
Front-End Integration: Create a simple front-end that utilizes Verida.ts for handling encrypted data storage, leveraging their decentralized identity (DiD) and encrypted identity services.
Stream Processing: Incorporate Red panda and Timely to manage real-time, streaming data effectively.
Hope and Inspiration: Embark on this technological journey with optimism and the drive to innovate.
